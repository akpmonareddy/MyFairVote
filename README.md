# MySafeVote

In this project, we are going to build a lightweight web-based application for digital
voting primarily focusing on Indian elections. By using this web application, voters
can vote easily from their electronic devices without having to travel to the voting
centers. We are integrating the concepts of Visual cryptography and Steganography
to make this process more secure. These features make our system quite effective
for real-time use during elections conducted on a large scale by providing accurate
voting results, ensuring the confidentiality of the voters, avoiding voter fraud, and
also reduces the cost of elections to as minimal as possible.
